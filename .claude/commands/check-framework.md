Verify compliance with all 8 Framework Rules from CLAUDE.md:

1. Data Source Hierarchy (snap_counts.parquet usage)
2. Feature Engineering (EWMA weighting, 54+ features preserved)
3. Model Training Standards (XGBoost, temporal CV, TIER 1 & 2)
4. Simulation & Probability (Monte Carlo, isotonic calibration)
5. Betting Logic (no-vig, Kelly, confidence tiers)
6. Validation Constraints (snap caps, injury adjustments, weather)
7. Production Deployment (data quality, weekly workflow)
8. Error Handling (fail fast, logging, validation)

Output: Compliance score (0-10) with specific gaps identified.
